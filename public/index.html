                What does shape the current state of Web Design? How can we leverage CSS to support the art movement on the Web?<br/>
                Letâs dive into art direction and trends to find a new way to express our design ideas in CSS. During my talk you will find more about the intersection of CSS code with collages techniques, anti-design aesthetics and much more. Everything will be combined with practical CSS and many examples you can use on your websites right away. I will be presenting some of my CSS experiments to show you that art has a true impact on CSS properties and new features.<br/>
                Find your inner designer and join me on this artistic CSS journey.

              <h3>Designing components for fun, profit and sanity</h3>
              <h4>Yishu See <a href="https://twitter.com/yishusee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@yishusee</a></h4>
              <p>
                In recent years, web applications have largely converged to a modular approach, where self contained components make up the basic building blocks of an app. Components have offered us a way to logic in bite size digestives but they can also grow to become huge unwieldy monsters. <br/>
                Imagine you find yourself five years into a project, in a team of 10, over a thousand components, and a chance (albeit daunting task) to start with a fresh codebase. How would you begin designing the components?

                Yishu is bad at things. Bouldering, speaking Japanese, crow pose; all bad. Thank goodness she's okay at making computers do things. Currently she is a software engineer at Carousell, contributing to the web platform. Before that in her career, she has taken on multiple roles - iOS engineer, backend engineer and fleetingly a product designer. Her current favourite function is .split().

              <h3>Variable fonts and the flexible nature of screens, environments and devices</h3>
              <h4>Mandy Michael <a href="https://twitter.com/Mandy_Kerr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Mandy_Kerr</a></h4>
              <p>
                Variable Fonts allow typography on the web to adapt to the flexible nature of screens, environments and devices. We can use variable fonts with pre-existing technologies to improve our font performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites. <br/>
                We can start to design our typography to adjust to various inputs, situations or events which might allow us to modify our fonts to aid in storytelling, or achieve improved readability and legibility in different situations, environments or on larger or smaller screens. <br/>
                Letâs begin to explore new and exciting creative opportunities for storytelling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. This is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts.<br/>
              </p>
              <p>
                Mandyâs passion is CSS, HTML and JS, she has a particular interest in web typography, accessibility and modern layouts, and hopes to inspire that passion in others. With the aim to create a community of web developers who can share, mentor, learn and grow together she is a co-organiser and Director of <a href="http://mixinconf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mixin Conf</a>, the founder and co-organiser of Perthâs front-end developer meetup <a href="http://fenders.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fenders</a> and currently works as a Development Manager at Seven West Media in Western Australia.

                We can use Web Components to create reusable solutions. With Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, the Web Speech API, and a little ARIA, we can create a progressively more advanced solution for anyone who wants to listen to content; and when the Accessibility Object Model (AOM) lands, we'll be able to do even more.

              <p>
                Most libraries and abstractions for creating graphics in Javascript are focused on 2D shapes (SVG and canvas) or simulating 3D rendering. The talk will instead explore generative graphics inspired by modular, analog video synthesizers from the 1970s, in which visuals are created by routing, transforming, and recombining multiple sources and outputs in realtime (such as cameras, videos, and application windows).<br/>
                By using WebRTC to share video peer-to-peer, each browser/device can output a video stream, and receive and modify video streams from other browsers/devices. Transformations to the color, coordinates, and blending of a visual source are abstracted as separate Javascript functions which can be chained and composited to create complex visual patterns. The talk will explore technical, aesthetic, and collaborative possibilities of treating a web app as a series of interconnected and heterogeneous nodes, rather than as a specific âsiteâ or âplaceâ.

                People make things. You make things. Most of the time you make Very Serious Thingsâ¢ï¸ that help your bosses sell more shoes or saxophones or those tiny coffee packets. And thatâs good, because you gotta eat and stuff. But something else has gotta eat, too: your brain. Music is creation, art is creation, code is creation. I think itâs important to goof around with code sometimes, or make things that let other people goof around with code. And sometimes, that becomes the Very Serious Thingâ¢ï¸. Magenta.js is one of these things; let's talk about it!

                Machine learning can have some pretty complicated concepts to grasp if youâre not a data scientist. However, recent developments in tooling make it more and more accessible for developers and people with little or no experience.<br/>
                One of these advancements is the ability to now train and run machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, opening this world to front-end developers to learn and experiment.<br/>
                In this presentation, we will talk about the different applications, possibilities, tools and resources, as well as show a few examples and demos, so you can get started building your own experiments using machine learning in JavaScript.

              <h3>Introduction to the Component-based API</h3>

              <p>
                The Component-based API is a new concept of API which pushes further from GraphQL the boundaries of how much data can be retrieved in a single request, how data is organized into an effective hierarchical structure, and how fast can data be retrieved from the DB. We will learn what this new API looks like, how to use it, and how our application can become more modular through it.

              <h4>Shawn Wang <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@swyx</a></h4>
              <p>
                The design of React Hooks requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this talk, weâll reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes â to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!

              <p><br/>
                There is a lot of developer and investment interest in JAMStack technologies, from the serverless movement to new authentication models to continuous atomic deployment to the static site generator renaissance. But with so many new terms and options, it is hard for people to figure out where to start.<br/>
                This workshop will teach developers to set up a simple but state of the art Gatsby stack, which lets people create blazing fast sites and apps with React and GraphQL, backed up by a continuous deployment and serverless platform complete with authentication and CMS. It has never been easier to get a great Lighthouse score, or to deploy complex, secure webapps for free.<br/><br/>
                <b>Requirements:</b><br/>
                Attendees should have git, Node.js and npm installed, and be proficient with JavaScript and React (including routing with @reach/router or react-router). <br/>
                Install the Gatsby CLI's ahead of time: <code>npm install -g gatsby-cli</code><br/>
                You do not need to know GraphQL, but you can get a head start by reading <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graphql.org/learn/</a> and going through the Fundamentals section of <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.howtographql.com/</a>.

              <p>
                  In today`s world the front end technology is evolving really fast. New frameworks are getting launched to simplify the developers life. But with the changing technology it`s really hard to move from one framework to another or update to the newest version. <br/>
                  Web components is a relatively new standard enabling front end developers to create cross frameworks compatible components. it lets you write reusable components with native browser Api with zero external dependencies. <br/>
                  In this workshop we will learn to build a web app with reusable components using web components (custom elements, Shadow DOM, Html templates, Modules). We will also get acquainted with helper library lit-element and how we can integrate these components with existing frameworks.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Requirements:</b><br/>
                  Prior knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required in order to follow along.<br/>

              <p>
                As the author of Vue, I often get asked on how the major JavaScript frameworks today differ from one another. Typically people expect technical details: size, performance, ecosystem... but to me, what fundamentally differentiates frameworks from one another is where a framework lands on the primitives vs. conventions spectrum. This is usually a conscious design decision, and the major frameworks we see today manifests three different segments of this spectrum. In this talk I'll discuss how these design choices have affected the adoption and growth of these frameworks, and why there might not be one single optimal balance point.

                There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out.<br/>
                But things are changing, if you can do <code>npm install @tensorflow/tfjs</code> or make an API call, you can now do AI.<br/>
                In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs.<br/>
                You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.

              <p>
                Do you lie awake at night wondering why you canât count up past 9 quadrillion in JavaScript? Have you ever been troubled by numbers that donât add up correctly or do what you expect (looking at you, 0.1 + 0.2)?<br/>
                JavaScriptâs numbers can behave a littleâ¦ unexpectedly at times, and cause bugs that can have you scratching your head for hours on end. From incorrect arithmetic to BeyoncÃ© showing up on your page twice as often as you expect, in this talk weâll take a look at the quirks that come from numbers in JavaScript & the strange issues they can cause.

                Itâs easy to create race conditions in JavaScript if youâre not careful. This talk is about dealing with common kinds of race conditions based on my experience working on a real-time collaborative app.

              <p>
                Have you ever noticed the recent trend where no one uses ES5 anymore? AOT compilers became a trivial thing nowadays; everyone uses it but very few really understand how they work. With the knowledge that I'm gonna give you in my talk, a new exciting world of possibilities will open up for you; you will understand how popular compilers such as TypeScript and Babel work behind the scenes and you be able to build cool Babel plugins. With this knowledge you will be able to not only implement things which aren't possible to do during runtime, such as ng-anotate, but you will also be able to save some precious processing power and make your apps more efficient.

              <h3>The *other* spec: Internationalization in JavaScript</h3>
              <h4>Ujjwal Sharma <a href="https://twitter.com/ryzokuken" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ryzokuken</a></h4>
              <p>
                No matter what kind of developer you are, in 2019, Internationalization is honestly kind of a big deal. Especially if you're building interfaces that transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br/>
                Over the years, the community has developed a set of tools for solving the problems in this area but they are non-standard, hard to keep a track of and in the best case, pretty huge.<br/>
                I will talk about the new Internationalization APIs in JavaScript, which solve these problems and give you a decent set of tools to build apps that work across different languages, currencies and cultures.
              </p>

                Ujjwal is a Node.js core collaborator, Electron maintainer, Google Summer of Code mentor and ex-student. An international speaker and a JavaScript/C++ developer, he has been working with the V8 team and the TC39 committee to help make JavaScript better, one commit at a time. He loves to talk about open source software, DevOps, JavaScript, Web Standards and the Open Web.

                You will learn about different image formats, their tradeoffs, how different formats are under the hood and the how the browsers handle images. <br/>
                Based on this, we will look at different techniques to optimise images based on the device, network and the browser the user is using. <br/>  
                We will be building an image optimisation pipeline which you can extend upon after the workshop. Having built such a pipeline at Dexecure, I will also talk about the challenges in building and maintaining such a reliable at such a pipeline the different gotchas to look out for in terms of performance, security, reliability and scalability.<br/><br/>

                Web Assembly has arrived in all major browsers. With it being in plain sight instead of hidden behind browser flags we can start and bring our high performance applications to the browser.
                In this workshop weâre going to look at the basics of Web Assembly and see what is already in the browsers today and what is yet to come. From there we will implement a real performance heavy task in our browser. We will compare the performance of our Web Assembly code to a plain JavaScript version.
                Afterwards you will be able to decide when to use Web Assembly and what specific performance benefits It will give you.<br/><br/>

              <p>
                80% of users are running browsers capable of running languages other than JS in their browser. It's a new change, but an important one; we're looking at a future where the web will be built not just on JS, but on C, Rust, even GoLang. Let's talk about WebAssembly; why it came about, what it's good at, and why it really doesn't spell doom for JS but instead allows you to truly enhance web experiences by augmenting JS with the ability to use modules written in other languages that can perform tasks faster or more efficiently. We'll go over what WebAssembly is, how to build a WebAssembly module, and why this may be a force that will shape not only how we think about JS, but the entire web experience.
